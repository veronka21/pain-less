# PainLess

This is the frontend of a web-application, which was made to give you exercise routines for strengthening and stretching your back and core, and therefore ease any pain related to these areas, and improve your posture. There are some previously generated workout routines, but you can create custom workout plans using the exercise library. 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.
The project's backend repository is available here: https://github.com/b-bence/fitness-app-backend

## Project status

This is my first Angular project, which will be a fitness web-application designed for people with back pain issues. There will be pre-built exercise routines, available from the backend database, and the user can also make custom plans from the exercises, which are viewed on cards, showing a gif of an exercise and the cards can be flipped to get written instructions. Custom plans will also be stored at the backend.
Future plans also include tracking the training history, and setting training goals.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/veronka21/pain-less
2. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine in order to run the frontend. Run `npm install` to get all used packages.
3. Using the Angular CLI, you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. (Angular CLI can be installed with the following command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`)
4. You will also need to download the backend repository (https://github.com/b-bence/fitness-app-backend) and follow the instructions there.
